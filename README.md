### A keni ligjerata?
Assignment 2 for Mobile Development Theory

# Description
Back at our university in Kosovo the library has a limited number of seats and most
get taken in the morning so if you want to study in the university you have to find a seat in
one of the many lecture rooms. These often are used by teachers for lectures so often end up
switching rooms all day instead of learning, so we want to create an application which helps
choosing the right room based on the schedule, also others should be able to add comments about different rooms and
like or dislike them.
