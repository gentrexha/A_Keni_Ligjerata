# Description:
Back at our university in Kosovo the library has a limited number of seats and most
get taken in the morning so if you want to study in the university you have to find a seat in
one of the many lecture rooms. These often are used by teachers for lectures so often end up
switching rooms all day instead of learning, so we created an interactive application which helps
choosing the right room based on the schedule, where others can also add comments about those rooms and share their experience.

# How the app works:

# Group experience:
The biggest problem for us doing this project was on finding a way on how to approach developing the application, we spent a lot of time in researching for different application architectures which would best suit our needs. Since we wanted that all of the classes availability to be displayed in one picture, because nobody likes reading big list of schedules just to find out if the class is free or not, we had to draw the floor plans our self. We spent a lot of time on developing an architecture to sync the schedule between the local database and the online one, so even if the user isn’t connected to the internet the application would still work.

# What's next:
The first thing which come to mind by extending the application is to make it work for other faculties as well, since all of them share the same problem. Adding a rating system for the comment section would be good as well since at the moment comments only get sorted by date, a method to identify owners of comments through Facebook or Google+ identification must be added aswell. Also another handy feature would be for the user to receive information in the form of push notifications for a certain class, i.e. Class gets taken in 15 minutes. From a maintenance perspective the comment system needs to be updated to be able to be moderated more easily and the schedule retrieving method needs to be more automated because inserting all of the lecture rows in the database by hand can get very frustrating.

# Risks associated with the application:
Probably the biggest risk factor in the application is that the schedule can't be taken 100% for reliable, a lot of schedules change dynamically through the semester, classes are occupied by students taking tests or different school meetings happen. Which means we have to make it clear to the user that we can’t take responsibility for the correctness of the schedule in our application.

# Business and financial opportunities:
Considering that each year almost 8000 new students register at the University of Prishtina [1] there exist quite a big user base for the application to be used. Although not all of them use Android, because of this the application could be migrated to iOS to reach a bigger user base [2]. Adding ads to the application would be a very good alternative to create profit while still keeping the application free and not disrupting user experience.
