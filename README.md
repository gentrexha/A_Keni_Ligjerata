# Description:
Back at our university in Kosovo the library has a limited number of seats and most
get taken in the morning so if you want to study in the university you have to find a seat in
one of the many lecture rooms. These often are used by teachers for lectures so often end up
switching rooms all day instead of learning, so we created an interactive application which helps
choosing the right room based on the schedule, also others can add comments about those rooms.

# How the app works:
